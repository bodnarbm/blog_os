# Writing an OS in Rust

A implemention of the OS laid out in Philipp Oppermann's blog [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

This repo is mostly just for tracking my own implementation as I go through the blog posts and walkthrough tutorials on
writing a custom OS using Rust. For the original source material, please see <https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os>.

## Deviations

A list of deviations from the original source material.

1. Using 2021 edition of Rust instead of 2018.
2. Prefering str over bytes when possible.
